# Internsavy.datascience_internship
This is a internship on data science at Internsavy. 
In this internship, I was given different tasks where I have used different Machine Learning algorithm.
Here are the tasks I was provided with.
Task 1- Prediction of Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective using diffrent classification techniques. Here I have implemented a few classification techniques like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree,k nearest neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Adaboost to predict graduate admissions and also checked whcih model performs better.
Task 2- Use clustering technique for customer dataset . I was given a Mall Customer dataset in which I have applied K Means Clustering.
Task3- Customer Segmentation Analysis. Here, I was given a Mall Customer dataset where I have applied K Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN clustering.
