# Internsavy.datascience_internship
This is a internship on data science at Internsavy. 
In this internship, I was given different tasks where I have used different Machine Learning algorithm.
Here are the tasks I was provided with.
Task 1- Prediction of Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective using diffrent classification techniques. Here I have implemented a few classification techniques like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree,k nearest neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Adaboost.
Task 2- Use clustering technique for customer dataset . I have used a Mall Customer dataset where I have applied K Means Clustering.
Task3- Customer Segmentation Analysis. Here, I have used a Mall Customer dataset where I have applied K Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN clustering.
